	IR -> DAG of IR
		DAG of operands and operations
		see notes in notebook i think
	
	Transform DAG from IR to abstract instructions 
	
	DAG is in SSA virtual register form
	Instruction selection is in non-SSA virtual register psuedoinstruction form
	Register selection -> physical register real instruction form
	
	DAG parts
	Class
		Type
			Parts
	
	Source Nodes
		Constants
			Optional Name
			Value
		Live-Ins
			Name
	Terminator Nodes
		Stores
			Inputs (2)
			Ordering chain
		Branches
			Destination Names (1, 2)
			Condition
			Comparison Inputs (0, 2)
		Assignments

	DAG source nodes 
	
	(unordered)
	-	Constants
	-	Live-ins
	-	Assignments? Or use named outputs
	-	Branch Targets? Or make part of branch instructions
	
	(partially ordered)
	-	Linear instructions
	
	(last)
	-	Branch instruction
	
	construction per BB
		BBArg defs are live ins
		BBArg assigns are live outs
		Conditional BBArg assigns need to be dealt with
		-	always both -> assign to all in original BB
		-	conditional -> branch targets with args produce additional BBs/DAGs, assigned regs become live-out
	
		traverse BB backwards. If the instruciton defines a live-out, has side effects, or no dead code
		elimination allowed, add to dag if not present. For each argument, add to dag if not already 
		present. Recurse for args of defining instructions.
		traverse BB in either order. Record ordering of side-effecting (STORE, CALL) and side-effected (LOAD)
		instructions.
	
	
	build DAG? list? from parts with side effects. These must be placed in order
	-	Live-outs
	-	Branch instructions
	-	LOAD instructions
	-	STORE instructions
